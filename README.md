# HW1_Refactor_adrian

The purpose of this assignment is to simplify the code!

Ok i know i didn't do the greatest but this is what is supposed to happen


.hero {
    height: 800px;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 25px;
    background-image: url("assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}

and more specifically >>> background-image: url("assets/images/digital-marketing-meeting.jpg");<<<

when you click on chrome devs, there are two little dots "url(..image)" that makes the page not
load correctly

Any feed back would GREATLY APPRECIATED!!
